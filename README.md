this works for me with python v2.7.9 on my raspberry pi 3, YMMV

it is still somewhat of a WIP and there are a few other things I may add in the future and some (very rare) bugs which I still need to iron out

this is the first thing i've written in a while and there may be some dumb mistakes, if so let me know
also this is the first thing i've uploaded to github, so I may have done some dumb things on that end as well, again feel free to let me know.
